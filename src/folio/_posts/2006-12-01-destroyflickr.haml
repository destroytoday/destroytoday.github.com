      Prior to DestroyFlickr, I only had experience with web development. Designing and coding for the desktop was completely new to me, and I loved that---the chance to experiment with a completely new platform. I targeted Flickr out of my frustration with the website. Its white background and static pages seemed like the wrong environment for photography. I changed everything I didn't like about the site and added a few extra features of my own. DestroyFlickr won an Adobe Design Achievement Award for Developer/Designer Collaboration.
