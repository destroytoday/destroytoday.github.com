I work with a very talented designer, [Kim Pimmel](http://kimpimmel.com/), who consistently knocks out killer work both on the job and in his free time---we share the same hunger for side projects. Earlier this year, he started a short film series titled, "Compressed." Kim released his [second of the series](http://vimeo.com/28304264) and it does not disappoint. Even after telling me exactly how he did it, I'm still dumbfounded. Below are a few stills and you can see [the actual film on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/28304264).
