          The letters were lasercut from clear plastic.

          The backs were spray-painted, so the front would still appear glossy.

          Two fishing lines were taped to the back of each letter.

          I set up the photoshoot using two 600 watt strobes to blow out the backdrop and two 300 watt strobes with softboxes to fill the letters.

          A 20 gallon fishtank provided the perfect container to hold the water in which the type would 'float'. I got it for free from a generous librarian.

          I used a boom pole to suspend the letters in the water.

          You wouldn't believe how hard it was to keep those letters from spinning.
