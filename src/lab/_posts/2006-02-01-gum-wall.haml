      Even though this is the antithesis of digital and many years old, it's still one of my favorite projects to date. I was asked to make anything, but it had to consist of at least one thousand of the same object. I decided to build a 2 inch wall 12 feet long out of 2,000 sticks of Juicy Fruit gum. I stacked them like bricks, using water as the mortar. I later extended upon the idea by building a six foot self-standing arch. The strength of gum is surprising.
