      For a long time, I was obsessed with printer patterns---the ones that printers spit out after cleaning the nozzles. I collected patterns from all over and found that even the same brand would differ its pattern from model to model. Around the same time, I worked more off-screen, mainly through screen printing. The above installation is a 12x8 foot screen print of the Epson R2400's printer pattern. Certain areas didn't print so well, but that's the point---the screens I used were in need of cleaning.
