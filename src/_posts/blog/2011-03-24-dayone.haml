    A few weeks ago, I tweeted about creating a private Twitter account to use as a journal. I dropped the idea after realizing that Twitter limits the number of viewable tweets to 3200. Cue Day One, a new OSX journal app. With a clean UI and simply gorgeous icon, the design alone sold me.

    Its desktop version ($9.99) utilizes a menubar window for quick and easy entries, and an accompanying iOS version ($0.99) syncs through Dropbox. Notifications appear throughout the day, reminding me to make an entry, which is just the motivation I need to keep with it. The only downside I see so far is the lack of a global hotkey. No worries, as itâ€™s expected early April. Kudos to Paul Mayne on a job well-done.
